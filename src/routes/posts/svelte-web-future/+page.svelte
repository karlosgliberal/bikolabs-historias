	<h3>I have an idea, how should I build it?</h3>
	<p>
		Web development is a beautiful way to create products. They are
		accessible through screen readers and
		<a href="https://www.afb.org/node/16207/refreshable-braille-displays"
			>braille displays</a
		>. Scalable globally in a few clicks with tooling like
		<a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> and
		<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Flexible enough to run
		on a
		<a

			>Galaxy Fold</a
		>
		or a
		<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/R9gbzzOLlgU/hqdefault.jpg"
			>Nintendo Wii</a
		>. The ability to create content that can be accessed by almost anyone,
		almost anywhere, by countless devices is powerful to say the least. Web
		tooling is important, it helps ensure that software developers can
		create the best products and ship them to the most people possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		In front-end development we are faced with a barrage of solutions to
		choose from to solve problems. As I entered back into the world of
		front-end development, I found that
		<a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>'s developer experience enabled
		me to work effectively and efficiently to develop higher quality
		products.

	<h3>Outdated</h3>
	<p>
		I wanted to create a web app after a 7 year hiatus from serious
		programming. I started again with the skills I learned in school. My
		Intro to Webpage Programming 101 class taught me the basics of HTML and
		CSS. This was my development tooling and process:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Tooling - </strong>
			<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, web
			browsers,
			<a href="https://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a>
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Develop -</strong> draft my content, structure with HTML tags,
			and style with CSS. Type, refresh, type, refresh, search, type!
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Deploy -</strong> drag my project into the correct folder using
			WinSCP to upload to my school's server.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Done!</strong>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		It was fairly quick, and I had an good understanding of every character
		I typed.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started with creating a website using the principles I remembered from
		this course. Almost every aspect of my tooling needed an upgrade. The
		basic functionality required for my app was to be able to send a request
		to an API, manipulate some data, and display it in a chart. I started my
		research for the best way to accomplish this.
	</p>

	<h3>What Kind of Bait do You Use?</h3>
	<p>
		Tooling is incredibly important in any project whether you are building
		in a real or virtual environment. Humans love to utilize the best tools
		possible in order to make sure they are spending the least amount of
		time doing things that they don't want to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just like developers enjoy spending their time writing innovative code,
		Fishermen like to spend their time catching fish. Immense thought goes
		into each tool fishermen utilize to make sure they spend their time
		effectively. A fishing stack might consist of a boat, pole, line, hook,
		and bait. Everyone needs to determine the right stack for the job they
		are trying to accomplish.
	</p>
	<p>
		I quickly realized that there is an infinite number of methods and
		stacks to accomplish these common requirements. I found I could not
		easily do this all from scratch. I read some articles about using
		front-end frameworks compared using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
		As you can imagine, I found a wide variety of opinions on the matter.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wanted to get building and ship fast. I could not learn or even
		attempt to try out every option, and I had nothing to show after a few
		weeks of work in my spare time. After a hours of research and countless
		tutorials I needed to make a decision. I heard Scott Tolinski talking
		about Svelte on the Syntax.fm podcast. I looked it up and found that
		Svelte and <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> were the tooling
		I was looking for.
	</p>

	<h3>Sin Tax</h3>
	<p>
		Syntax is a steep hill to climb as a beginner, Svelte was the smallest
		hill I could find. As someone who had a basic understanding of HTML,
		CSS, and JavaScript, Svelte's syntax was comfortably familiar. I was
		spending much less time paying JavaScript boilerplate taxes and spending
		more time catching fish. There were less imports, functions, and
		returns. Script, markup, and styles working together in a simpler way.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>How do I create a prop?</i>
		<Code>export let count = 0;</Code>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>How do I render a list of items?</i>
		<Code>
			&#123; #each cats as cat &#125 <br />
			... <br />
			&#123; /each &#125
		</Code>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>How do I initialize the state of a component?</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>React:</strong>
		<Code>const [count, setCount] = useState(0);</Code>
		<strong>Svelte:</strong>
		<Code>let count = 0;</Code>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>
			To learn more about Svelte's simple syntax, check out this
			<a href="https://svelte.dev/blog/write-less-code">post</a>
			from Rich Harris discussing Svelte syntax compared with
			<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and
			<a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>.
		</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		I understood the code I was writing, and I immediately felt more
		comfortable with Svelte than any other front-end framework I had tried.
	</p>
	<p>
		I came to the conclusion these efficiencies could greatly decrease my
		time to ship. First, I could get through the
		<a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics">Svelte tutorial</a>
		in just a couple days. Second, I knew I was coding with fewer errors. This
		could dramatically increase my efficiency in the long run. Svelte allowed
		me to save time on each line by eliminating key strokes and requiring less
		code to brain translation through its simpler syntax.

	<h3>&lt;One svelte=to bind:them&gt;</h3>
	<p>
		Some of the best tools are the ones that solve the widest variety of
		problems. Svelte and SvelteKit provide me with a flexible method to
		create a wide variety of products. From single components to entire
		applications Svelte can be utilized to build high quality products.
		Although Svelte's community is far smaller other frameworks like React,
		Svelte is gaining traction. One of the most recent web apps released
		that has been exciting the Svelte community is the new
		<a href="https://beta.music.apple.com/">Apple Music player</a>. This
		demonstrates how Svelte can be utilized for something as simple as this
		blog post to an enterprise application.

	<h3>Levels of Complexity</h3>
	<p>
		All of programming can be abstracted to different levels of complexity,
		from binary, to Python, to a "no-code" tool like
		<a href="https://webflow.com/">Webflow</a>. Abstraction has allowed
		programmers to have a better developer experience and get things done
		faster. Abstraction's rival is flexibility. As languages and frameworks
		become more abstract and enable developers to work faster, they often
		limit them in what they can accomplish. Svelte takes a step forward in
		abstracting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides efficiency in the
		syntax and quality in final product delivered. Svelte manages to push
		the abstraction boundary while maintaining flexibility. Where you can
		use JavaScript, you can use Svelte.
	</p>
	<p>
		Svelte not only enables developers to write less code with a carefully
		crafted developer experience, but also it enables them to ship less code
		resulting in a better final product. Svelte and SvelteKit allow me to
		build more performant and accessible websites right out of the box.

	<h3>Truly Innovative</h3>
	<p>
		In
		<i>
			<a
				href="https://books.google.com/books/about/How_Google_Works.html?id=Yk9zAwAAQBAJ"
				>How Google Works</a
			>,
		</i> Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg discuss what makes a truly innovative
		product. They characterize innovation as being "new, surprising, and radically
		useful."
	</p>
	<p>
		Svelte takes a new approach to developer experience through being a
		compiler instead of a framework. This enables Svelte to have its own
		language and work outside the constraints of JavaScript when necessary.
		Regardless if you are a beginner or advanced developer, the clarity and
		familiarity of Svelte is undeniable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Svelte is surprising in the flexibility it has amidst the extra layer of
		abstraction. Svelte can work where JavaScript works, it is
		unopinionated, flexible, and fast. I personally enjoy using VS Code,
		Vercel, and Tailwind to create websites. I have found Svelte to be well
		supported by all of these with tutorials and plugins.
	</p>
	<p>
		Svelte is radically useful for me to quickly create websites using the
		existing skills that I have. I am able to easily apply my skills and
		share code with others due to the simplicity of the language. Other
		people's code is easier to understand with less boilerplate, resulting
		in smaller barriers to entry for open source contributions.
